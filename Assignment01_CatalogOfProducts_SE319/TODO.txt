    I added a layout idea for the about section, color and placements are NOT final,
    If you wanna have a looksie and see if you like it.
    was mainly using colors to help me see where the grids were,
    planning to have a gray background where our info cards are instead.

    Finalized the look I was going for, let me know what you think when you see it.
    Still could use some adjustment, but we have time.

    Caleb - I think the colors look fine

    Added my about info and changed the layout for the about page so that it is centered
    and that the other information is wrapped when there isnt enough room. Also added border
    around the social media icons.

    Added cards to the first catalog which you can name what you want. I figured since theres two        ---Sounds good! I like the art idea, i'll add some of my own stuff later. -Griffin
    catalogs we could each just do one of our own.

    Named the second catalog and added images for the catalog. Changed the size of the images
    so that the aspect ratios are correct. Got rid of unnecessary code for the cards. Moved
    some css into an external css file.
