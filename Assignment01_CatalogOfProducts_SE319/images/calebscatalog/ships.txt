I this is a drawing that did a long time ago in high school. It is about 12"x24", so it one of my bigger drawings, and is done on normal art paper done with graphite. This drawing took about 2 months to do in total. I enetered it into an art competition in high school and won two purple ribbons for it. I am still the only person in the school to have gotten two purple ribbons for an art piece in that art competition.
